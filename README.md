# SwitchHack

**The most in-depth, noob-friendly post-CFW companion guide for the Nintendo Switch.**

SwitchHack picks up where the initial hack left off. Once you've installed Atmosphere CFW on your Switch, this guide walks you through everything else — theming, emulation, homebrew apps, game library management, online play, and more.

## What This Is

SwitchHack is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. It serves as a comprehensive reference for Nintendo Switch owners who have already installed custom firmware and want to get the most out of their modded console.

**This is NOT a jailbreak/CFW installation guide.** For that, see [switch.homebrew.guide](https://switch.homebrew.guide). SwitchHack covers everything *after* the hack.

## Pages

### Homepage (`index.html`)
The landing page. Introduces the project, highlights key features, and links to the guide, intel page, and community Discord.

### Post-CFW Companion Guide (`guide.html`)
The core of the project. A single-page guide organized into 5 zones:

| Zone | Topic | What's Covered |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **01** | Customization & Theming | Custom avatars, profile icons, game icons, Tinfoil/CyberFoil themes, activity log themes |
| **02** | Advanced Emulation | RetroArch setup, emulator cores, ROM management |
| **03** | Essential Homebrew Apps | NRO homebrew apps, SD card root utilities |
| **04** | Game Library Management | Buying from Nintendo eShop, DBI Installer (USB install), CyberFoil + Ownfoil (network shop) |
| **05** | Community Play & Extras | Online play, fake user accounts, community resources |

### Economics of Digital Access (`intel.html`)
A data-driven page presenting research and industry perspectives on digital access and piracy. Includes the suppressed EU displacement study, pirate demographics, and sourced quotes from industry leaders.

### Status Monitor (`monitor.html`)
A live dashboard for the Switch hacking scene. Powered by scraped data from GBAtemp, Reddit, and GitHub, processed through AI classification.

- **Release Feed** — Filterable list of games, updates, DLC, and homebrew with risk badges and timestamps
- **HUD Strip** — Current firmware, Atmosphere, and Hekate versions with threat level indicator
- **Scene News** — Latest headlines from GBAtemp and GitHub releases
- **Reddit Sidebar** — Top posts from r/SwitchPirates sorted by upvotes

Data is generated by `scrapers/intel_processor.py` which reads `switch_scrape.json` and produces `monitor_data.json`.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Markup | HTML5 |
| Styling | [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) via CDN |
| Fonts | [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) (body) + [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono) (code/mono) via Google Fonts |
| JavaScript | Vanilla JS — shared nav (`nav.js`), no frameworks |
| Data Pipeline | Python + DeepSeek API (AI classification of scraped data) |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages (static, no build step) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions (`daily_update.yml`) for automated data refresh |
| Design System | Glassmorphism on `bg-slate-900`, neon accents (cyan/emerald/purple/pink) |

No build tools, no npm, no bundler. Open any `.html` file in a browser and it works.

## Design

The site uses a **"Cyberpunk Apple"** aesthetic:

- **Dark glass cards** — `bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-xl border border-white/10 rounded-2xl`
- **Neon accent system** — Color-coded per zone (emerald, cyan, purple, pink)
- **Terminal blocks** — macOS-style window chrome (red/yellow/green dots) for code snippets
- **Pixel art GIFs** — `image-rendering: pixelated` for retro visuals
- **Responsive** — Mobile-first, works on all screen sizes

---

## Running Locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SwitchLibraryAdmin/SwitchLibraryArchive.git
cd SwitchLibraryArchive

# Open in your browser
open index.html
```

No server required. Everything is static HTML with CDN dependencies (Tailwind, Google Fonts).

### Updating Monitor Data

The status monitor requires Python and the `openai` library:

```bash
pip install openai
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your-key-here'
python3 scrapers/intel_processor.py
```

This reads `scrapers/switch_scrape.json`, runs AI classification via DeepSeek, and writes `monitor_data.json`.
